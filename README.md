# TDD-kata
These [Katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) are designed to help practice what a test of a pure 
function ought to look like. It is intentionally designed to start with a very easy, non-branching base case which 
slowly becomes addled with complexity as additional requirements are added that will require significant branching and 
eventually a pressure to compose additional units.

The repository contains some TDD katas of various diffeculty.
